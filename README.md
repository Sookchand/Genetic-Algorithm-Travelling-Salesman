# Genetic Algorithm Travelling Salesman

This is a solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library. The TSP is a classic problem in computer science, where the goal is to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once. The DEAP library provides a set of tools for implementing evolutionary algorithms in Python.
